1. i'm doing a project called "adsb based aircraft tracking system using rtl-sdr"
this project uses an rtl-sdr (software defined radio) to receive adsb signals broadcasted by an aeroplane. this data is captured and it's iq samples saved to a .bin file. 
i need to get the number of adsb signals in the bin file latitude longitude and altitude data from each adsb signals. 
please refer the file "iq_samples_20251019_180842_675.bin" in the directory "..\adsb_misc\iq_samples\" and tell me what you interpretted from this, also give me the structure of a typical adsb signal
also tell me what you understood from this prompt

2. thanks, now i want to run the decoder code to output a json file in the format
[
 { lat1, lon1, alt1,
   lat2, lon2, alt2, 
   ....
 }
]
when i run the command 
    <decoder program name> <input binary file name> <output json file name>
into the terminal

3. i want to save the json files to a directory "position_json" and also the json files should have the lat, lon, alt of a particular entry in the same line as opposed to right now where it's split into 3 lines
for eg: if there's 3 entries (each with it's respective lat lon alt), then i want each entry in 1 line, so a total of 3 lines only but right now, it's 9 lines in total

4. now i want to get the output position data (lat, lon, alt) into a CSV format with suitable headings. 
this file should be structured similar to the current output JSON file.
